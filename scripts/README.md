# Bookbear Scripts

The scripts in this directory are used to download data from Wikidata and
store them locally as CSV files.

Because we are requesting quite a lot of data, and Blazegraph is easily
overwhelmed by complicated queries, we get data in a stepwise process:

1. Download all known authorâ€“work pairs as Q codes only (`authorships.ts`)
2. Hydrate authors and works respectively (`authors.ts`, `works.ts`)
3. Aggregate the three downloaded files into one file, combined with view
   counts from a `pvduck` generated database.

## Commands

```bash
npm run scripts authorships  # Get Q codes and author-work relationships
```
