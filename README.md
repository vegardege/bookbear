# Book Bear

Book Bear is a web page giving you an overview of the literary works of all
authors known to Wikidata. The page displays whether the work is considered
notable and how popular it is on Wikipedia.

The goal is to give you an indication of where to start with a new author,
or just to gauge the popularity of an author's works.

## Getting Started

Note that the source of this page is shared in the spirit of sharing. I have
not tried to make it easy to reproduce the page. The instructions below may
be lacking.

To build the page from scratch, you need a pageviews database. This file is
generated by [https://github.com/vegardege/pvduck](pvduck).

Once you are happy with your pageviews aggregation, you need to download data
from Wikidata and aggregate it in to a JSON file:

```bash
# First, get Q codes for author-work relationships and notable status
npm run scripts authorships
npm run scripts notables

# Second, hydrate the author and work objects with data
npm run scripts authors
npm run scripts works

# Third, aggregate all files into one
npm run scripts aggregate /path/to/your/pvduck.duckdb
```

Once the file is ready, you can run the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
